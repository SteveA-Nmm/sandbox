Problem statement N19_6457 mixer spur

there are 6 bands. 
The start frequencies don't fit to a fixed step size. 
A 10MHz step size would land on every start and stop frequency.
How do i index into the calibration table and step to the next test frequency?

solution
What was used on _A9? 
	Cal_Start_IF = 4500
	Cal_Stop_IF_Freq = 11600

	Cal_Start_RF_Freq = 18000
	Cal_Stop_RF_Freq = 40000

	Cal_Step = 100

Ok, measure within 40Mz of Start and stop frequencies.
band1 4500   close to 4480
band2 5700   close to 5660
band3 6300   close to 6340
band4 6600   close to 6620
band5 6800  actual 6800
band6 4800  actual 4800

so the caltable is every 100MHz, for a total of 71points. 
How do i enter it at band2 and continue. ?

Excel_Open_IF_Cal_File loads up IF_Data_Table


blank:?:? Calibrate_IF_Input_Power:Excel_Open_IF_Cal_File
Main:SETUP_INITIAL:Excel_Open_IF_Cal_File >>> loads IF_Data_Table from an excel cal file

and there is the answwe3e=er  answer
The cal file drives what input frequencies can be used and the order must be known before hand.
The rest of the program is hardcoded for the index into the cal file. 
It can NOT jump around given a frequency; you must know the index explicitly. 

What i want is :
cal table as big or small with whatever steps I choose. 
cal table stays useable between programs. 
interpolate between frequencies,
warning if frequency doesn't exist in cal table.

What i Need to do this is
a way to search the table for a frequecy and return the calibration associated with it.

found it
Excel >> Utilities >> Search Array
constraints, featurs
requires excel utilities open,  (program must manage what excel file are open and explicitly close one by one when done)
assumes there is only one index into the array. if column 0 has two identical values only the first is seen. 
typically not a problem when cal tables are simple start stop step.

no need to manage array index to pull the frequency. just pull the correct frequency.

does it work with 1601 points?
