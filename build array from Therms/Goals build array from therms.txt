Goals :

build an array of N number of records
	each record has 2 fields
	the 1 field is the temperature
	the 2 field is the data taken at that temperature

Why:  Every test is taken at 1 or more temperatures. 
	Write code that grows and builds the data array as needed from a user configuration file.
the value of the temperature changes from model to model and even from test to test within a given model or production run
	

flow chart sudo code:
1.)
read the temperature values in from a text file
create an array the size of the number of temperatures in the text file
each field in the array is named incrementally therm0, therm1, therm2, ... ,thermN
The value of each temperature field is the temperature setting
	
2.)
use this array to build a data array for the data at each temperature setting

3.)
unbuild the data array to individual records and send to named ranges in a worksheet.
the named ranges will be therm0, therm1, therm2, ... ,thermN

4.)
