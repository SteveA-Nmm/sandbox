why? the ErrorArray is used to validate the calibration method desplayed back on the ScalarNetoworkAnalyzer. Therefore 801pts matches.... or does it matter.

input range is 4.48 -- 11.6
split into six subsets and subsets are normalized into 801pts.

What is the reason for using normalized 801pts on the scalar network analizer? It only has 4 nonvolatile registers for saving calibration and I need 6. Also, reloading regisisters from disk is slow. Using 1 nonvolatile register with daptive normalization is the built in feature.
