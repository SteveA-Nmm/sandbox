6.7.4	Calibration. 

6.7.4.1		Calibrate for IF & Test Port VSWR and Test Port Insertion Loss and save the calibration in Register 2 of the Scalar Analyzer. 
The IF VSWR frequency range is a sub set of the 2-18GHz calibration and the excel worksheet plots only the correct frequency range.
Sweeper settings: 
Start frequency 2GHz, Stop frequency 18GHz, 
Sweeper Power Level setting -3dBm 
Power Slope ~= 0.13 dB/GHz to acheive a "flat" power across band. 
Nominal power across band should be between -10dBm and -15dBm measured with the Scalar's own detector.

Scalar settings: 401 points/sweep, 
Channel 1, measure A, detector; display MEAS-MEM, Trace Format dB 
	calibrate thru to directional bridge
	scale 5dB/div , position 4

Channel 2, measure B, directional bridge; display MEAS-MEM, Trace Format  SWR
	calibrate Short/Open VSWR
	scale 1dB/div, positon 4

Save calibration to Register 2. 


6.7.4.2		Calibrate for RF VSWR and save the calibration in Register 3 of the Scalar Analyzer.
Sweeper settings: 
Start frequency 26GHz, Stop frequency 40GHz, 
Sweeper Power Level setting -3dBm 
Power Slope ~= 0.13 dB/GHz to acheive a "flat" power across band. 
Nominal power across band should be between -10dBm and -15dBm measured with the Scalar's own detector.

Scalar settings: 201 points/sweep,
Channel 2, measure B, directional bridge; display MEAS-MEM Trace Format  SWR
 	calibrate Short/Open VSWR
	scale 1/div , reference level 2 SWR, position 4

Save calibration to Register 3


6.7.4.3		Setup for Test Port Switch On/Off Isolation calibration and save the setup in Register 5. 
Sweeper settings:
Start frequency 2GHz , Stop frequency 18GHz , 401 points/sweep , Power level -15dBm nominal 

Scalar settings: 401 points/sweep , Power level -15dBm nominal 
Channel 1, measure A, detector; display MEAS-MEM 
	<This is a setup only.  Register 5 can not save calibration data.
	The calibraton is done live for each DUT. 
	Isolaton of thru port of the DUT and will change with each new DUT.>

		Save setup to Register 5
